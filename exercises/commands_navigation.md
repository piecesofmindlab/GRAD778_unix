# Bash commands
This page contains some basic bash commands for navigation and finding help that we will use during our introduction to the command line. We will tell you what to type during the lectures, but we have found that it's very nice to have a copy-able version of the commands ready at hand. 


# Special characters & operators
* `~` refers to the home directory in *nix systems

* `..` or `../` refers to the directory above the current directory

* `.` or `./` refers to the current directory

* `*` wild card operator for `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, and many more: fits *anything* matching the rest of the pattern, e.g. `ls *.txt` lists all files in a directory that end in "`.txt`". 

* `>>` send output to a file, e.g. `echo Hello world >> hello.txt` or `ls *txt >> text_files_in_dir.txt`


# `man` page (same as `less` command) shortcut quick reference:

* `/` is find (type after the slash and press enter to search for an exact word or phrase)

* `n` is next instance (after searching for something)

* `<shift>-n` is previous instance (after searching for something)

* `q` is quit man
