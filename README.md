## Morning Session Agenda
For the morning session, much of the class will be done at your own pace, potentially with other students in a breakout room in Zoom. There will be regular live check-ins at or near the times listed below. Instructors will close break-out rooms when it is time to come back to the main room for the next section to start.

* 09:30 a.m. Basic navigation from the command line (ML)
	* Live session w/ introduction & instructions
	* [Video](https://unr.canvaslms.com/courses/57767/modules/items/1380098) explaining navigation & basic unix commands (follow along w/ exercises)
	* As time permits: Software carpentry exercises on navigation, found [here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir/index.html). See if you can answer all the <span style="color:orange">questions in orange</span>.

* 12:00 noon Basic Scripting (ML)
	* Video for scripting (separate videos for [Mac](https://unr.canvaslms.com/courses/57767/modules/items/1382227) and [Windows](https://unr.canvaslms.com/courses/57767/modules/items/1382226))
	* Note for Mac users: if you have downloaded a text editor such as SublimeText or Atom, you don't need to use Textedit, and line endings will be handled correctly without any fuss. 
	* **Complete your first webcampus assignment, [here](https://unr.canvaslms.com/courses/57767/modules/items/1381089)** Note that this is part of the basis for your grade in the class! 
		* This assignment can be completed locally, on your home computer. Copy the text of the script you write into the assignment on webcampus. 
		* For an extra challenge (not part of the assignment), try to use a command-line-based text editor (nano) to copy the script to your VM, and run it there. 
* 12:30 p.m. Lunch break

## Afternoon Agenda
For the afternoon session we will have several short live slide presentations followed by time allocated to working through the text_processing_tutorial.md in [GitHub repository text_processing directory](https://github.com/tparchman/778_unix/tree/master/text_processing), which would be best viewed online.

### Approximate time agenda:
* 1:00 p.m. Package installation; Basic process monitoring and control
	* Sections I and II of the [tutorial](https://github.com/tparchman/778_unix/tree/master/text_processing)
	* Includes a package installation and job control exercise using `jot`

## Tracking points for Module Credit

You must complete the two assignments for this module ([here](https://unr.canvaslms.com/courses/57767/modules/items/1381089) and [here](https://unr.canvaslms.com/courses/57767/modules/items/1381090)) by tomorrow night (Sunday, 9/6, at 11:59 pm) to get credit. Assignments will be graded generously, so long as you upload *something* for both of them!
